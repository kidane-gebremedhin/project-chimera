# Project Chimera: Governance & Development Rules

## 1. Project Context
**This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system.** All development, architectural decisions, and agent behaviors must align with the goal of creating a self-sustaining, high-integrity autonomous influencer network.

## 2. The Prime Directive
> **NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first.**

* Before proposing or implementing any technical change, the `specs/` directory must be indexed and reviewed.
* If a specific module or feature lacks a definition in `specs/`, you must request or create the specification before proceeding with code generation.

## 3. Traceability & Execution
**Explain your plan before writing code.**
