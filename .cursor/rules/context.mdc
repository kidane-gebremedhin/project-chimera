## 2. The Prime Directive
> **NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first.**

* Before proposing or implementing any technical change, the `specs/` directory must be indexed and reviewed.
* If a specific module or feature lacks a definition in `specs/`, you must request creation the specification before proceeding with code generation.
