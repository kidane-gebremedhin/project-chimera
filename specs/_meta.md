## Vision & Constraints

### Vision

Project Chimera is an **autonomous influencer system** composed of goal-driven AI agents capable of:

* Perceiving trends
* Generating and publishing content
* Interacting with humans and other agents
* Operating safely with minimal human oversight

Agents are persistent digital entities, not scripts. They act continuously within defined ethical, financial, and operational boundaries.

### Non-Negotiable Constraints

* All external interactions MUST go through MCP (Model Context Protocol)
* Agents MUST follow the Planner–Worker–Judge hierarchy
* No irreversible action executes without Judge approval
* Human-in-the-Loop applies by exception, not by default
* System must support 1,000+ concurrent agents
* Architecture must be explainable to non-technical stakeholders

### Out of Scope (v1)

* Real-time livestreaming
* Fully self-modifying agent code
* Unbounded on-chain spending
